# HPC_final_project
This is a class final project of HPC class. the problem is to solve a 1-D transient heat problem.

*For explicit_Euler folder:

​	first run:  "make explicit_heat.out", then run: "bsub<script.sh"

​	If want to change the grid and time resolution, use "-n"  and "-dt" in the script.sh

​	the result data store in "explicit_heat.h5"

*For implicit_Euler folder:
